In this React Native Expo I am  attempting to integrate SIP functionality using the SIP.js library within a WebView component. The goal is to create a cross-platform mobile application capable of making VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) calls using SIP technology.

To achieve this, you've created a WebView component in your React Native code, which loads an HTML file containing the SIP.js library and associated JavaScript code for initializing the SIP client and handling SIP calls.

The app allows users to perform the following actions:

1. **Initialize SIP Client**: Users can click a button to initialize the SIP client, which involves registering to a SIP server using provided credentials (e.g., username and password). This step establishes the connection between the app and the SIP server, enabling communication.

2. **Initiate SIP Call**: Once the SIP client is initialized, users can initiate SIP calls by providing the SIP URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) of the callee (the party they want to call). Upon clicking a button, the app triggers the initiation of a SIP call to the specified URI, facilitating voice communication between the caller and the callee.

The app is designed to provide a seamless and intuitive user experience for making SIP-based calls within the React Native Expo environment. However, you are encountering issues with loading the SIP.js library within the WebView component, which is preventing the proper initialization of the SIP client and subsequent SIP call functionality.
